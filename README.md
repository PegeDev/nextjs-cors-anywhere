# vercel-cors-anywhere

Just [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere). but made to deploy with vercel.

Header forwarding is not supported. Will do, If I need it.

## Use

`Deployed URL`/api/?url=https://example.com

## Caching

All requests will be cached for 10 minutes if the URL is the same.
